# Description 📁

This project showcases a Spring-based web application that provides a comprehensive solution for user authentication, authorization, and efficient data management within a secure environment. The primary goal of this project is to create a seamless user experience while ensuring the utmost security of user information and interactions.

# Key Features 🔑
* User Authentication and Authorization: The project employs Spring Security, a powerful framework, to implement robust user authentication and role-based authorization. This ensures that only authorized users can access specific parts of the application.
* Enhanced Data Validation: The application integrates email validation and password matching to ensure the accuracy of user-provided information during registration and password reset processes.
* Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): It utilizes Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to efficiently exchange data between different layers of the application. This promotes encapsulation and minimizes unnecessary data exposure.
* Flexible Database Management: Hibernate, a widely-used ORM framework, is integrated for seamless database management. This allows developers to interact with the database using Java objects, making data manipulation and storage more intuitive.
* Maintainable Codebase: The project adheres to SOLID principles, emphasizing modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. Proper separation of concerns and dependency injection techniques are employed to create a clean and organized codebase.

# Project Overview  📖 📝
The project includes the following key components and features:
- User registration and login using Spring Security.
- Email validation and password matching.
- Use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for data exchange between layers.
- Data Access Object (DAO) interfaces and implementations for data persistence.
- Integration of Hibernate for ORM and database management.
- Implementation of SOLID principles for maintainable and scalable code.
- Detailed README.md providing project setup, installation, and configuration instructions.

```
 
# Configuration : ⚠️

The project is configured with 
- Spring
- Spring Security 
- Hibernate 
- and other dependencies. The ***pom.xml*** file contains detailed configurations for these dependencies.

 #  Email and Password Validation 🔧

The project includes email validation and password matching. For email validation, a custom annotation @Email is used, and for password matching, @MatchPassword annotation is used. Details can be found in respective classes.

# EmailValidator 🔨

The EmailValidator class is used for email validation. The @Email annotation is used to mark methods that accept email addresses. The validate() method is used for email address validation.

# PasswordMatcher ✒️

The PasswordMatcher class is used for password matching. The @MatchPassword annotation is used to mark methods that accept passwords. The matches() method is used for comparing two passwords.



# SOLID Principles ⚙️

The project adheres to SOLID principles to ensure maintainable and scalable code. It includes appropriate separation of concerns, interfaces, and dependency injection to promote modularity and flexibility.
